# Abstract Factory Example

This code is an application example of the _Abstract Factory Pattern_[1]. It shows a simple maze game with different types of enemies and walls. These different types are created using an Abstract Factory.

## Explanation

This example was used during Computer Games lessons of the [Multimedia Degree](https://cvnet.cpd.ua.es/webcvnet/planestudio/planEstudioND.aspx?plan=C205&lengua=E&caca=2016-17) at the [University of Alicante](http://www.ua.es).
